# **üíª 42 C++ Piscine**

Welcome to my **C++ Piscine** experience at 42! üéâ  
In this immersive program, I dove deep into the world of **C++ programming** and mastered all the essential concepts in just **10 modules**! Each module was packed with **hands-on exercises**, challenging me to apply what I learned in real-world scenarios. From the basics to more advanced topics, this was an exciting journey that covered everything I needed to know to become proficient in C++.

## üéØ **Project Overview**

The **C++ Piscine** at 42 is structured into 10 distinct modules, each focusing on a specific theme and packed with several exercises to sharpen your skills. Here's what I learned:

### üìö **Modules and Themes:**
- **Module 0Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£: Basics of C++ (Compared to C) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
  - Introduction to C++ syntax and features, focusing on the differences with C. We also covered the basics of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and how they are applied in C++.

- **Module 0Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£: Memory Management, References, Member Pointers, and Switch Usage**
  - This module covered **memory management** in C++ with an emphasis on **references**, **pointers to members**, and using the **switch statement** for control flow.

- **Module 0Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£: Ad-Hoc Polymorphism, Overloading, and Orthodox Canonical Classes**
  - Exploring **ad-hoc polymorphism** (function overloading and operator overloading), along with the concept of **orthodox canonical classes** for proper management of resources in C++.

- **Module 0Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£: Inheritance**
  - This module was all about **inheritance** in C++, exploring how to create derived classes and use the features of the base class. We also learned about **constructor chaining** and **virtual inheritance**.

- **Module 0Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£: Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces**
  - Delving into **subtype polymorphism**, we explored the use of **abstract classes**, **pure virtual functions**, and **interfaces** to create flexible and reusable code structures.

- **Module 0Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£: Try/Catch Functions and Exceptions**
  - Focusing on **exception handling** in C++, we learned how to use **try/catch blocks** and the **throw keyword** to manage errors and exceptions effectively in our programs.

- **Module 0Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£: Various Casts in C++**
  - This module covered the different types of **casting** in C++, including **static_cast**, **dynamic_cast**, **const_cast**, and **reinterpret_cast**, and when to use each of them.

- **Module 0Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£: Templates**
  - Introduction to **templates** in C++, allowing us to create **generic functions and classes** that work with any data type, enhancing code reusability and flexibility.

- **Module 0Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£: Template Containers, Iterators, and Algorithms**
  - Focused on **template containers** (like `vector`, `map`, `list`), **iterators** to traverse them, and how to apply **algorithms** like `sort()`, `find()`, and more in the **Standard Template Library (STL)**.

- **Module 0Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£: Containers, Parsing, and Sorting Algorithms**
  - The final module involved working with **containers**, learning how to implement **parsing** techniques, and applying **sorting algorithms** (such as quicksort or mergesort) to efficiently manage and organize data.
